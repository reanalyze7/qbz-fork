//! Single-instance guard (issues #544/#559 — Tauri parity: the old app
//! shipped tauri-plugin-single-instance; the Slint rebuild lost it, so
//! every click on a pinned taskbar shortcut / launcher entry spawned
//! another full player — reported on both Hyprland and KDE).
//!
//! The first instance takes ownership of the well-known session-bus name
//! `com.blitzfc.qbz` (Flatpak auto-grants owning the app-id name — no
//! finish-args change needed) and exports a `com.blitzfc.qbz.SingleInstance`
//! interface with `Present()` and `OpenUrl(url)` methods. A second launch
//! sees the name taken and calls `OpenUrl(url)` when its own argv carried a
//! Qobuz deep link (the primary presents itself AND navigates — Tauri
//! parity, the piece #618 didn't port) or `Present()` otherwise — which
//! raises the main window — and works from process start, login screen
//! included — and exits. If the primary predates the interface (≤2.0.x) the
//! call errors and the second launch falls back to the MPRIS `Raise`
//! method, which only exists after session entry. `OpenUrl` failing on an
//! older primary (interface present, method missing) falls back to bare
//! `Present()`. Any D-Bus problem — no session bus, weird sandbox — falls
//! through as "we are primary": the guard must never block startup.
//!
//! Blocking zbus API on purpose: this runs once on the main thread before
//! the UI exists, and the async-io executor self-drives the connection
//! from any context (the zbus 5 "tokio" feature is FORBIDDEN graph-wide —
//! see the rfd/ksni comments in Cargo.toml).
