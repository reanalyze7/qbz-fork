//! Track drag-and-drop state — the tracks currently being dragged onto a
//! sidebar playlist. The UI (DragState global) drives the ghost +
//! drop highlight; the actual track refs live here (the global only
//! carries a count + ghost text).
//!
//! The payload is SOURCE-TYPED: a row dragged from a Qobuz surface carries
//! its catalog id, a LocalLibrary file row its `local_tracks` row id. The
//! drop arm maps each variant to the right playlist ref (`qobuz_track_id` /
//! `local_path`) — storing a library row id as a Qobuz id is what made
//! dropped local rows resolve as unavailable (hidden, D11).
